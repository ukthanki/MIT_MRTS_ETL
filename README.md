Up to this point in the course, we had learned the following topics:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. SQL
4. Linear Regression
5. ETL Fundamentals

In this project, we explored the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) data set for the years 1992-2020 and perform an Extract-Transformation-Load (ETL) process through a variety of steps. We then analyze the data for trends, percentage changes, as well as rolling time windows paired with visualization for enhanced understanding of the data.

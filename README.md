## ETL, Analysis, and Visualization Project
  
In this project, we explore the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) data set for the years 2020-1992 and perform an Extract-Transformation-Load (ETL) process through a variety of steps. We then analyze the data for trends, percentage changes, as well as rolling time windows paired with visualization for enhanced understanding of the data.
